# 🚨 PENTESTER ATTACK VECTORS & DEFENSES

## Attack Vectors They WILL Try:

### **Attack 1: JWT Token Manipulation**
**What they'll do:**
- Steal JWT token from cookies
- Modify the email field in JWT payload
- Try to access with modified token

**Your Defense:**
✅ httpOnly cookies (can't access via JavaScript)
✅ Signed JWTs (tampering detected)
✅ Server validates EVERY request
✅ Email checked against hardcoded whitelist on server

**Additional Hardening Needed:**
🔧 Add JWT signature verification
🔧 Check token expiry
🔧 Validate issuer

---

### **Attack 2: Race Condition**
**What they'll do:**
- Login quickly
- Try to access data before email check completes
- Exploit async timing

**Your Defense:**
✅ authChecking state blocks all rendering
✅ No DashboardLayout until verified
✅ Middleware runs before page loads

**Additional Hardening Needed:**
✅ Already secure - no race condition possible

---

### **Attack 3: Direct API Access**
**What they'll do:**
```bash
curl https://dashboard.sixtyfour.ai/api/credits \
  -H "Cookie: stolen-session-cookie"
```

**Your Defense:**
✅ Credits API checks whitelist
⚠️ Other APIs might not check!

**Additional Hardening Needed:**
🔧 Add whitelist check to ALL API routes
🔧 Workflows API
🔧 Langfuse APIs
🔧 Metrics APIs

---

### **Attack 4: Client-Side Bypass**
**What they'll do:**
- Modify React code in browser
- Change `isAuthorizedEmail` to return true
- Disable auth checks in DevTools

**Your Defense:**
✅ Server-side middleware checks (can't bypass)
✅ API checks on server (can't bypass)
❌ Client-side checks CAN be bypassed!

**Additional Hardening Needed:**
✅ Already have server-side checks (client bypass doesn't matter)

---

### **Attack 5: Cookie Theft (XSS)**
**What they'll do:**
- Inject JavaScript to steal cookies
- ```<script>document.cookie</script>```

**Your Defense:**
✅ httpOnly cookies (JavaScript can't read)
✅ React escapes output (XSS-proof)

**Additional Hardening Needed:**
🔧 Add Content-Security-Policy headers
🔧 Add X-Frame-Options

---

### **Attack 6: CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery)**
**What they'll do:**
- Create malicious site
- Make requests to your API from their site
- Use victim's cookies

**Your Defense:**
✅ SameSite cookies (prevents cross-site)
⚠️ No CSRF tokens

**Additional Hardening Needed:**
🔧 Add CSRF tokens for POST/DELETE requests
🔧 Verify origin header

---

### **Attack 7: Session Fixation**
**What they'll do:**
- Force victim to use attacker's session ID
- Victim logs in
- Attacker uses same session

**Your Defense:**
✅ Supabase generates new session on login
✅ Old sessions invalidated

**Additional Hardening Needed:**
✅ Already secure

---

### **Attack 8: Environment Variable Exposure**
**What they'll do:**
- Try to access .env files
- Look for exposed API keys in client bundle

**Your Defense:**
⚠️ .env.local might be in repo
⚠️ Keys might be in client code

**Additional Hardening Needed:**
🔧 Verify .env is in .gitignore
🔧 Only NEXT_PUBLIC_ vars go to client
🔧 Service keys stay server-side

---

### **Attack 9: Timing Attack**
**What they'll do:**
- Measure response times
- Determine if email exists in system

**Your Defense:**
⚠️ Different error messages for different failures

**Additional Hardening Needed:**
🔧 Constant-time comparison for emails
🔧 Same error message for all failures

---

### **Attack 10: Account Enumeration**
**What they'll do:**
- Try different emails
- See which emails exist in system

**Your Defense:**
⚠️ Error messages might leak info

**Additional Hardening Needed:**
🔧 Generic error: "Invalid credentials"
🔧 Don't say "email not found" vs "wrong password"

---

## 🔒 FORT KNOX UPGRADES NEEDED

### **Priority 1: Critical**
1. ✅ Add API whitelist check to ALL API routes (not just credits)
2. ✅ Add security headers (CSP, X-Frame-Options)
3. ✅ Verify .env not in repo
4. ✅ Add rate limiting

### **Priority 2: Important**
5. ✅ Add CSRF protection
6. ✅ Generic error messages
7. ✅ Constant-time email comparison
8. ✅ Validate JWT signatures

### **Priority 3: Nice to Have**
9. ✅ Add RLS to database tables
10. ✅ Add audit logging
11. ✅ Add IP allowlist
12. ✅ 2FA/MFA
