# Cursor AI Rules for This Project

- Clean up ALL temporary files immediately after testing
- All production code must be in src/ directory
- Use console.log for debugging, remove after testing complete

## Database Safety

- Never make changes to ANY DATABASE
- Only read from database, never write/modify

## Code Quality

- Preserve existing functionality when refactoring
- Document complex logic inline with comments
